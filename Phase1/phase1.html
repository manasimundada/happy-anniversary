    <p class="intro-text">So this page is meant to replicate the cineworld page because we used to watch a lot of free movies together, so I wanted this to be significant of that. However, I largely underestimated how hard this would get, so this is the only page that is kind of creative. 
        So my challenges started from the very beggining when I couldn't even access the cineworld website, so Aarany had to send me a 2 min long video of the website so that I could correctly replicate it. She also told me its too empty so now you get to read this for no reason. The actual website had a sale banner, so here is a banner that tells you have lots to read. Yay! I promise the next ones arent as painfully bad

            <p class="intro-text">Hi, welcome to the pre-dating but just as besties era. This era is further broken down into 4 chunks, because this was 5 years long. Each phase is shown as a movie. I tried really hard to be cool and quirky, act like you really like it pleaseeee. Please click on each 'movie' to find out more about it</p>
