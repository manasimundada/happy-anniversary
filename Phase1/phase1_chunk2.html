                    One fine day, the boy asked the girl if she wanted to watch a movie for free with him. Girl (asked her mum, made sure she was ok with and then obviously) said yes, and thus, from here forth, their relationship took off. Ahh this was an era, every wednesday after school I'd take the train to Wembley central and a bus to you from there. Weirdly enough, I do not have many photos on my phone of just the movie dates, but I guess within this time only I was like OMG boy and girl and I was so pick me about it, Iâ€™d be like oh my gosh gross boyfriend, no way! When in reality that's all I wanted to hear. This was when we still pretty young but we actually became good friends. We realised we do enjoy each other's company and that we're actually solid mates. Aww this was when Nikita aunty had a ganpati at her house and I realised that all I wanted was you, realised that you meant a lot more to me than I thought you did. Here's also where your cousins had the whole Manasi aunty(still hate you for that) phase and Khush wrote that I'm your grilfriend. Gosh hopefully they'll soon learn that it's pronouned bhabhi not aunty. Somewhere along this time, I was allowed to come to winter wonderland with your entire family. CRAZY.                </p>
