                    Ahhhh the first photo is the weekend before the lockdown hit. What a wild time of life. Facetimes ALL DAY LONG. I’d sit and do my textiles at ungodly hours of the night, you’d stay up with me(nothing has changed). Movie recs, countless house parties, games of psych and housie (sniggering away at the mention of the number 69, thinking we were sleek with it) and honestly it all feels like a fever dream. You surprised me at home and I did at chachis. We asked our parents to marry each other and unfortunately we got varied answers(I say we redo this). Somewhere along the line, we really got to know each other, we became real best friends, we, by this point, had told each other everything. Somewhere along the line one of us told the other we loved them, and we came to realise the feeling was mutual. You asked me out, I obviously said no for very many reasons, looking back I'm proud of younger manasi, younger us to be honest. We dealt with it quite well. This lockdown portion was an era, we definitely realised we had feelings for each other, feelings that little 14 year us knew was stronger than most, that wouldn't just fade away. We somewhere along the line planned our lives out, how we’d get married and have children one day(eeeeeek). Ok that’s all for this section. God I love you bubu, younger Manasi would think this life was a dream come true.                </p>
