                Ahh, Hi, I didn’t initially plan on this being a whole separate chunk. But Hi, I quickly want to talk about they sexy time. We had sex!!!! We had sex bub. It was perfect. It wasn't EXACTLY what I thought but it was perfect. I want to go from they start, if I am giving it a whole page of its own. From they start bub, When we were at your house and you tried kissing me and I flinched, you have let me be in complete control. Asking very discreetly and politely, making sure to take things at my pace. There was a LONG journey. I would barely make out with you. You managed to take this weirdly scared girl and teach that it’s ok, that she can take as long as she needs. That her needs are just as important. Of course you never forced me, but it’s how you genuinely let me take more time than I needed. That’s a lot of time. From the time when you first saw my boobies because you were kissing on them in the woods and I screamed no, to when you finally got to actually see them, you’ve made me feel completely valid and also like the- as you put it- lengest girl in the world. Every time after sexy time, when I would completely zone out and get all weird about whatever we had done, you held me, you kissed me and hugged me and told me everything I needed to hear. The thing is, I still don't really know why that happens to me. Why I react like that after, or many times, even during, I still don’t know. When I’d start breathing too heavy or you could somehow tell that I wasnt comfortable, thank you. Thank you for always stopping to check, stopping to make sure I was completely ok. Even if that meant your little willy started hurting. Thank you for letting me take as much time as I needed, with as many silly boundaries. Where showering together, and putting the tip in was allowed but having sex wasn't. Thank you for listening and immediately following when I’d randomly ask for you to close your eyes if I was turning around and you were going to see anyways. Thank you for, even now, on call telling me that you want me to wank as well. That it’s ok if I want to stop or talk in between and asking every time before cleaning up if you can go and reassuring me that you’ll be quick. Thank you for taking as much time as I need for sex. Thank you for sleeping naked with me, but never once mentioning it. The sex we had was amazing bub. I knew when you were talking to me, when we were naked and under the sheets together, having a really important conversation, that you were they one, you were so kind and caring and you wanted me to do so well in my life, I was lookin at you thinking how did I get so lucky. How did I get someone like you? I thought to myself, this is the guy I want to marry, this is they guy I want to spend the rest of my life with. This is they guy I want to have sex with. So I asked you, you said yes, I jumped up and waddled my naked self to the toilet. I came back and you asked “right now?” we got into bed struggling with the condom, laughing all around being so goofy and just like us. I asked you to give me head, or I can’t remember if you just gave it, but you gave really good head (I’m a little tingly just remembering it) and felicia told me to get fingered before, and so I asked you to, but it hurt because your nails were too long. I didn’t want to ask for head again, because even though it’s amazing, I know you’re not a huge fan. You gave it again without me asking for it. I pulled your silly little face up and made out with you, feeling so calm, I told you to put it in a bit, and then long story short, it was all in. It felt so nice, so good, I couldn't stop smiling. I had sex (the big, bad, forbidden thing that I was so scared of), I had sex with my favourite person. It was great, thank you for making it so perfect for me. Thank you for it all bub. Thank you for the times after this when you kept asking if I was going to cum, and what I’d like so that I could cum. I know it sounds like such a small, silly thing, but it means everything to me. I love throwing it in every girl's face, that not only did it not hurt, it felt amazing, and it felt amazing because my mans gave me they most amazing head, twice, and he asked what to do to get me to come. Thank you bubu. Sex is so nice with you. Thank you bubu, younger Manasi would be so happy for me. Thank you, I love you. YAYAYAYYAYA
