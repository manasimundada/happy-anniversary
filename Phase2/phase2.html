                I was madly in love with you. I still remember the day in Kota when I had a free house after a long time, and I was cleaning my room and I just told you how I was still in love with you, I just knew I was. You made me feel so amazing, and I just knew somewhere in my heart that this feeling I had was definitely special and what’s called ‘being in love’. Ok one sec I’d also just like to mention how when I lost my ring at the wedding, all you said was don't worry about it, go enjoy the wedding (my little sweet bubu). Anyways, Fast-forward to when I’m just about to come back to the UK, you Nimai, you were the only one who was about to catch me and the only person who asked when I'd come back and wanted to plan stuff with me. And when I surprised you, God, that 10-minute-long, silent hug should’ve just told us to date right then and there, but honestly there were very many points that should’ve told us that, but all in its right time I guess. From that point, I don’t know what I was thinking or doing, not just saying yes to dating you, but I guess younger Manasi didn’t want either of us getting hurt, and she wanted to have that cool, independent, strong girl feeling for a little longer. The following two and a half weeks were core denial (mostly from my side) and you being the sweetest, most tolerating bubu. The way I’d come to your house, we’d chill in your bed play-fighting, making some of my now favourite videos on my entire camera roll. Just being kids, goofing around, and having fun, just being us in its full essence. Hehe and then somewhere around this point you asked me for Valentine's Day in the most lowkey cute way. And I obviously, just to be an idiot, said no. In my defence, I thought I didn’t want anything, and I didn't want to lead you if I knew that I didn’t want anything. I somewhere here also had a call with my brother where he told me very strictly that I was leading you on and I needed to stop. We then went on our little predating date 13th February 2022, we went out properly, the day you say that you knew that you were definitely in love with me, honestly, I could definitely tell, bubu you’re so cute ahhhhh. I tried so hard to not lead you on this day and I remember Felicia mentioning your Spotify playlist covers and I felt so hehe giddy about it like a little girl. This was overall such a fun day. Then we have the 17th February 2022, the day on which I decided I was going to be a big, responsible girl and tell you that we were just better off as friends. That the two of us being together was impractical and silly and that we’d hurt each other so it's best to make the wise decision. Fun fact, I did do all of that. I cried in front of my bubu for the first time (but it barely counted). His parents picked him up because it was late and he went and began to play a game of Val (which made me think I probably made the right decision but I wanted my attention. GOSH.) Anyways fun fact I don't know if you remember me telling you this, but halfway through the day later I was in the kitchen and I think my mumma tried saying something funny and cute and I must’ve smiled/laughed and she said thank god it feels so good to see you happy, you looked so sad the whole day (this was obviously still in the era where I was mentally stable). AH what an effect love can have on people. Anyways I was a sad bean for a whole day or two and I called my brother, probably only to hear what he said to me. You and everyone that knows us has heard this before but one more - “I was on a one-hour-long call with my brother and basically he said Manasi I’ve heard you to talk about this clown for 5 years now, he’s the only guy you’ve ever spoken about, stop being an idiot and go ask him out.” To which I had my faltu response that bla bla no relationship and he told me that I’d either regret being in the relationship and never even trying, and I knew instantly I never wanted to go through the latter. I then asked you to meet up, with no context might I add, You, of course, agreed to randomly meet at the mandir, having no clue of what was your way. And now, we move to the “Just Dating” Era
