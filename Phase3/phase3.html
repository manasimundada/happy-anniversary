                On the 19th February 2022, I asked probably one of the most important questions of our lives and I cannot explain in words how happy I am that you said yes. I think that was the single best decision I have made in my entire life. I remember feeling so hehe giddy that you said yes. I thought it was unreal that I get to call you my ‘boyfriend’, I'd say it over and over cause I felt like a little girl and I couldn’t believe it. But wow I did not know how much it would end up meaning to me. 2 days after becoming your girlfriend, you took me out with TEN of your friends which I don’t understand why I said yes to, that was a lot. Anyways that day I ran out of the Photo Booth cause you tried giving me a sweet pappi. I met two girls that I have become so close to(this will be a common theme, but bubu you gave me a life I never could’ve even thought of) . I branched out SO MUCH because of you and you are genuinely so much of my happiness I love you forever more. Soon after, I left for India again, but neither of us knew that that would only last 1 month. I don’t recall much from being in India, just that I thought it was really fun and cool that I had a boyfriend and my brother once called me a donkey and said that I’m the issue and you’re not. Anyways I landed back in the UK, and soon after we went out on our first ‘date date’ obviously really cutely planned entirely by you, and we kinda had our first official kiss?! (sorry for being such a baby). Anyways following this we’d mostly meet outside, going on walks or on lil dates here and there, they’d usually be every 1-2 weeks. Around this point I began to realise how deep love can go, I realised that this was only the beginning, and I was going to fall so much more in love with you. Oh also omg you came over to my first for the time (a bit of a meet the parents) I was so so scared to do anything in the room (I honestly don’t think I ever imagined that you would come to my house this often and become part of the family like this) We went on our little walk dates after school(did a lil saucy in the woods, saw your willy for the first time), this was when we were beginning to properly get into the relationship you know. Also because I didn’t know what to expect from a relationship, as I was the first in my friends group to experience this, so at every stage I’d be like oh WOOOOW (cause it wasn’t just a fun reel I saw on instagram, love was something completely different). Hehe somewhere along this phase I had come back from my first holiday(aww I also remember this holiday you kept telling me to go have fun and I just began to realise how good of a person you are). Anyways, I came back from the holiday super sick and long story short we went to your house home alone and got caught. Aww also we had some of our first arguments here (I remember thinking omg what now). As I was saying, I remember being a very sad bean cause we got caught. You continuously tried calming me down and telling me that it was ok. This whole first 3ish months was us beginning to realise we actually had a transition from best friends to dating and I remember very clearly being all surprised like a little child every step of the way. Now, we move onto our first summer!!
