                Our first summer together, ahhh. Where the reality of it all kicked in. Where we hit the ‘6 month phase’, where we’d get annoyed at each other and have little arguments repeatedly all the time. I’m going to just say it and call you out here and say that I think you were mostly more in the wrong than I was. I think we were very young and were just learning to navigate our relationship. I remember you wanted me to do well in my SATs and you pushed me so hard it ended up hurting a lot. Moreover, I went on a bunch of holidays and was super busy. I had family come over and didn’t have much free time. You didn’t bother making an effort with my brother =which hurt and still hurts so much, but ok I’ll stop complaining. I think looking back we also know now that it was so overwhelming. We barely got time for each other or for just the two of us. Most of the photos from this time are with the jokemen. It was so overbearing, I’m glad we learned how important it is to make time for just the two of us. Also looking back , thinking about it all I just wanna be a crybaby for a minute and say how I personally think you were way too harsh during thai time. However it’s all ok, glad to know I can call it out properly at least. We started saucing more here(had a couple of free house meets which definitely helped). You saw my boobies for the first time hehehe(I still remember it so clearly god I love you bubu). Huh weirdly I don’t have too much to say for once. Wow how unlike me.            </p>
