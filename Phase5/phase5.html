AHHH, when the peace came back. When it became Nimai and Manasi in its truest form. It all went uphill from when you came and surprised me at garba. I still remember Naomi saying “Mehak’s with Nimai and they're trying to find you”,  I tried acting all chill like "oh no way, " but internally I was screaming, crying, throwing up because my bubu made it!!! Garba I lowkey lost you and I kept trying to find you, but what made it all worth it was the drive back home, wow, just holding your hand in the backseat and staring at you talk(in that ungodly hot hindi), I knew I was MADLY in love. From this day on, we had figured it out. We had matured so much in our relationship, we learnt how important it was to find the balance. To give time to ourselves, to give time to what’s most important to us. This day was followed by a central date to that doodoo restaurant mehak suggested, but really the only thing important was us knowing we had so many parties lined up and so we took time to ourselves before the back to back parties, to just soak it all in. We then for WEEKS straight back to back parties. Now, I’m not going to go crazy in detail for each of these parties (cause we need to fill in your scrapbook). But Nimai around this time was when everyone around  me couldn’t help but point out how much happier I was with you. How much value you added to my life. How you gave me that ‘teenage dream’, you were the reason I learnt to socialise properly, make new friends, try out new clothes(basically I’m saying you made me a slut). Bubu I genuinely mena it when I say you gave me a life I would've never dreamed of, you made me the girl I wanted to be(only kind of). I was doing online school during this time, I was so unstable and this is when I claim that I  believe  you fell in love with a bit of a scam. I guess we both gave each other lives we couldn't have dreamt of. No but this part is when I honestly had so much love for you, I didn’t know what to do with it. I could tell I was obsessed with you, I had never felt a feeling so overwhelmingly strong before. You took me to all these parties, made me feel like the most loved girl in the world always bub. You allowed me to be as stupid about sexy things as I wanted to be, However insecure, however many random boundaries I’d set. You wouldn’t say a word about them. This phase in my opinion is THE high school relationship (but healthy). We’d go to yours because it was a free house SO much. Took so many naps, did so many small naughties, gave you a handjob, you fingered me, I kinda gave you head, we put the tip in, we did the naughty in a toilet and with the door open and parents home. Speaking of parents, we got so much closer with each other’s families, had breakfasts, lunches and dinners with each other's parents. Personal favourite big family photo is somewhere there on the left as well. You had a disabled leg, I came and surprised you with a REAL LIFE GOOD MORNING KISS(I can’t wait to do this for the rest of my life.)  So many little things/milestones. And along the way we fell so so much more in love during this point, but of course, one day I had to find out that I’d be leaving for India for 4 months in 2 weeks time. We spent the rest of the time together very well if you ask me. I honestly have no regrets(thank you bubu). Still mad at you for playing val the day I was leaving though. But no I’m not gonna cry, let’s end this phase on a happy note and let’s move onto the Kota Long-distance now.        </div>
