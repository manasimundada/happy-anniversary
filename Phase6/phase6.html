                I don’t have too much to say about this part. Let’s actually see how much I manage to bak bak up. I moved, feeling more in love with you than ever. You were (and are) SUCH a supportive boyfriend. Always pushing me to do my best. This was such an easy to navigate era (but I will also say, both of us never complained, we acknowledged that it wasn’t too hard). Yeah around 6PM BST and 11:30 PM IST, we’d call for around an hour, I’d tell you all about my day, watch you fall more in love with me each call, and in response you'd maybe speak for 5 minutes about your day. This was also when I realised just HOW MUCH attention you paid to me. Man my standards are through the roof (whispers: I can't wait for one day when we have our little vaani who’s just as talkative as us and goes on and on about her day and she has a papa that just listens and makes her feel like everything she says makes sense, even though its a load of bak bak). Anyways, you’d bring up things I had said 3 years ago, just aise hi bolte bolte and you’d remember it, down to the very last detail. I remember I’d just hear you recite the details back to me in complete awe of how I got the cutest bubu known to mankind. This was also the start of lots of phone sex, (and as a result getting stupidly caught at like a 50% rate. When will I ever learn?) I have a random memory for this time that I just want to mention. When the time difference was going to go from 5.5 hrs to 4.5 and I got the day wrong and you said oh we’re so stupid, there was no we, I was the only one who said that. I think it comes part from watching my parents/ family always play the blame game and seeing someone not only not blame, but share it was so weird to me. Anyways, we’re coming closer to the next phase, but before the summer before Uni started, I remember I had a couple of things that I really wanted to do, and of course you just said go Manasi go do it, do everything you want to, don’t think about me. Manasi went and did those things but obviously at the end came and saw you and that began the Summer Before Uni.
