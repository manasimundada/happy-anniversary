                Ahhh, this starts from when I landed in India. I’ve described this to a bunch of people, and I always describe it in the same incredibly violent sounding way. It felt like my heart had been ripped out and stepped on and then put back. I cannot explain the pain I felt in words. Aw yay when you’re reading this I think you should try to explain how you felt cause you never really say. The pain I felt was actually inexplicable. It felt like there was an insane weight on my heart, and it physically hurt. I cried to my brother and he watched me just bawl my eyes out and gave me the most concerned hug. I went to uni having no hopes, I’m not going to lie though, I think it was having my whole family with me and knowing I had you, the first few days of uni I was able to socialise, like I don't know what my point is actually. Anyways, the first month of uni was BUSY. I didn’t if I was going to tell people about you and I was trying to cope with everything. You were there for me. You were through and through. I’m so so sorry I wasn’t. I can’t make excuses. Bubu I love you with all my heart, thank you for being my everything. Thank you for not once complaining (actually one day you did send me a salty instagram post) about how little I was able to talk to you, thank you for telling me to not stay in campus when my mum came, and to just go home, thank you for trying to get me to do work. Thank you for everything Nimai. Wait, I want to  talk about everything properly. I’m sorry I was so stupid and ignorant and got lost so much that I hurt you so much that you cried (but yay you cried for me)  I think I was trying to enjoy uni, and make friends and do all the things you’re meant to do, that I was so irresponsible I forgot to give the most time to what’s most important to me. Thank you for telling me off and giving me reality checks when I needed them the most. Thank you for at least making me realise that I was messing around too much, and that I was fucking up my life and I’ll be honest you were a little harsh, but I get it, I’m surprised you ddin’t leave me. You had given up so much, everyone around had made so many sacrifices, and the weren’t just for me to mess around like this. I’m sorry for being such an idiot. Thank you for being so patient. Thank you for pushing me to be the best, even if it hurt you the most.  Anyways, after just under 2 months of me putting this day off, the time had finally come to actually make the big boy decision. You were going to go to uni soon, and so 2 days before, on the 20th September 2023, I told you I was finally ready. That I was ready for us to finally, officially break up. We (only I) cried, and even today I think it was a very beautiful experience. It was very peaceful, silly and unnecessary(but everything happens for a reason) but it was sweet. I’m also sorry for doing it so late and at such a bad timing. I had exams within a few days, and you had uni starting. We had now *officially* broken up. It hurt. However we were preparing for this so it felt ok. You had let me take all the time I needed and you said it was my call, and that I could call it off when I felt ready, and you patiently waited (gosh I should’ve just never done it) Anyways, soon after (Bub we lowkey had breakup sex) we tried slowly fading. I tried making a conscious effort to not tell you everything about my day. It was working. I thought it was going to get better. Then on the 3rd October, 2 weeks after the breakup, you told me you wanted to call, and that it was nothing serious. Shit I thought I was over it, it still hurts. You told me you wanted to tell me something. You promised it wasn’t a big deal, I guessed that you made out with someone, you said I was right, and I was ok, I thought I was, we were broken up anyways. I left to go to my room and I heard you say it in your voice. I felt my drop. My Nimai had already moved on. The past 1.5 years meant nothing to him. He had moved on and done what everyone said he would, he had a random girl come over. I ran to my room and facetimed you. You asked me again and again to say something, I had nothing to say. It hurt so incredibly much that I genuinely didn’t know what to say. I felt betrayed but I know it’s not fair to say that because we weren’t dating. It hurt so much knowing that that was all I meant to you. That you were willing to give it all up for some girl. I called my brother. He hated you, told me to never talk to you again, said he would kill you if he ever saw you. I had Harshikaa come over, we had ice cream and did the rom-com post break-up scene. I called you again(and fuck you, you said you were sleepy), I didn’t sleep that night. This is in this phase because although it was a very very immature decision on your part, it was a big boy decision. After we lowkey kinda hit rock bottom we moved onto The healing.
